Miniblox Bad Word Blocker
Tired of toxic chat ruining your Miniblox experience? This userscript filters out profanity, slurs, and spam so you can actually enjoy the game.
What does it do?
Simple - it blocks inappropriate messages before they show up in your chat. When someone sends something nasty, you just see "Message Blocked!" in red instead.
Important: This only changes what YOU see. It's client-side only, doesn't touch the game server, and other players aren't affected at all.
Features

Blocks profanity and offensive language
Filters slurs and hate speech
Catches spam (people spamming the same message)
Can block ALL CAPS spam (optional)
Detects bypass attempts like "f*ck" or "sh1t"

Installation
You'll need a userscript manager like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey. If you don't know what that is, just Google "how to install Tampermonkey" for your browser.
Once you have it installed, grab the script from this repo and add it as a new userscript. Refresh Miniblox and you're done.

How it works
The script intercepts chat messages on your end before they display. It checks each message against a word list, and if it finds a match, replaces it with the blocked message. That's it.
Think of it like an adblocker but for toxic chat.
Will I get banned?
From GitHub? Nah. Content filters are totally normal. GitHub has tons of repos with word lists and profanity filters.
From Miniblox? Extremely unlikely. This script:

Doesn't give you any advantage in the game
Doesn't mess with other players
Only changes what you see on your own screen
Is purely for filtering content

It's basically the same as using a browser extension that blocks bad words on websites. You're fine.
